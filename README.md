## ðŸš§ Angular libraries use Ivy
[RFC](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38366)

[GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/angular/projects/2)

Available in 11.1, see [this article](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2021/01/27/angular-linker/)

Some more details in [Angular biweekly meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rC5dz7AkCZP813daT_bccbS-20OLmXgBVi50CSKx148/pub) from March 23, 2021.

The partial compiler for libraries won't become default until Angular 13.

## ðŸš§ Ensure smooth adoption for future RxJS changes (v7 and beyond)

No public movement yet. rxjs seems to work fine with Angular 12-next.6 in my simple project.

Here's [one PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/41590) that aims to improve some compatibility with the latest versions of RxJS.

RxJS 7 is now officially released.

## ðŸš§ Transition the Angular language service to Ivy

[GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/angular/projects/1)

Available in 11.X versions. Enable experimental mode in VS Code extension settings.

## âœ… Increased security with native Trusted Types in Angular
Available in 11.X. I think all the big parts are done.

Some more PRs in progress [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/40499), but no movement since Jan. 2021.

## ðŸš§ Enhanced Angular Material components by integrating MDC Web

Available in [Material Experimental](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/master/src/material-experimental). Seems to be close, but unlikely to become the default in 12.0.

## ðŸ¤« Offer Google engineers better integration with Angular and Google's internal server stack
Internal project. Unlikely to have any public movement or benefits.

## ðŸš§ Streamline releases with consolidated Angular versioning & branching

Some details in [Angular biweekly meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rC5dz7AkCZP813daT_bccbS-20OLmXgBVi50CSKx148/pub) from March 23, 2021. It sounds like there are some difficulties.
